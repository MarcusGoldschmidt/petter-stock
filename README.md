# petter-stock

Help and learn with simple stock

My cousin ask me to help her with expiry dates
of her products, so I decided to work in this project for fun.

Excel probably solve this problem, but I am a developer who wants a excuse to learn new things.

## Goals

- [ ] Jwt
- [ ] Real time enter and exit products
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Notifications about product validity
- [ ] Multi tenants
- [ ] Google login
## Stack

- Elixir (Phoenix Framework)
- Postgres
- React

Just for learning functional programing in web apps
